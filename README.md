# AI/ML Learning Path
A list of (mostly free) ressources to learn Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## University Courses

The following courses have their slide, notes, homework, and/or videos available online:
- [CS188: Intro to AI](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html), based on *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*
- [CS229: Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)
- [CS230: Deep Learning](http://cs230.stanford.edu/)
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.github.io/)
- [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html)

## Books
- *Hands-On Machine Learning  with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow*, the [associated Github repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml) has tutorials as Jupyter notebooks.
- *Deep Learning with Python*, by the creator of Keras

## Textbooks
Mathematical background for machine learning (but you probably want to look elsewhere if you are not used to maths):
- **Free** [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)

To have a general tour of techniques in artificial intelligence read AIMA:
- [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

Use these textbooks to get a grasp of machine and statistical learning:
- **Free** [A Course in Machine Learning](http://ciml.info/)
- **Free** [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
- **Free** [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/)
- [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/)

Learn deep learning with these:
- **Free** [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
- **Free** [Deep Learning](https://deeplearningbook.org/)

If you want to learn reinforcement learning, this one is the reference:
- **Free** [Reinforcement Learning, 2nd Edition](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html)

## Papers

To get into Deep Reinforcement Learning, this review is nice:
- [An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12560)

Use the [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/) to find new papers to read.

## Frameworks/Libraries
`numpy` and `pandas` are essential, `numpy` is basically everything math-related whereas `pandas` is all about manipulating data.

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

`scikit-learn` is part of the bigger `scipy` framework but works as a standalone. It contains a lot of non-deep learning machine learning algorithm and many preprocessing methods. Perfect for learning linear/logistic regression, SVMs, or tree-based methods.

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

PyTorch and TensorFlow are pretty much competitors, chose one and implement everything with it. Keep a distant eye on the other.

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Keras is a layer of abstraction on top of TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano (which it uses as a backend).

- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
